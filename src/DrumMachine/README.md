# DrumMachine

Contributed by Mateusz Wojt \<<mateusz.wojt@outlook.com>\>

## Description

This is a very simple drum machine containing of kick and snare, based on DaisySP SyntheticBassDrum and SyntheticSnareDrum modules (which are ported from Mutable Instruments Plaits I think). You can trigger the drums with footswitches and tweak the characteristics with the knobs. Additionally, the toggle switches control the decimator and wavefolder effects to achieve more variation in the drum sounds.
